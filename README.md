## **1. Introduction** :pushpin:

- **Objective**: This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on various factors that possibly have an impact on the price of used phones and tablets, and eventually develop a model to assist the pricing strategy for these screen devices.

- **Target Audiences**: The findings may provide some meaningful insights for Marketing, Sales and R&D Department working on the screen device industry.

## **2. Methodology**:microscope:

- **Data Source:** ["Used Phones & Tablets Pricing Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/used-handheld-device-data) uploaded by AHSAN RAZA on Kaggle - a popular working environment for workers in Data and Machine Learning.

- **License:** The data is available for download under CC0: Public Domain License.

## **3. Findings Summary** :bulb:

After the EDA is performed, it can be seen that the price of used screen devices could be influenced by: 

+ The amount of RAM
+ When the device model was released
+ Resolution of the front camera in megapixels
+ Resolution of the rear camera in megapixels
+ Size of the screen
+ Energy capacity of the device battery
+ Normalized price of a new device of the same model
+ Operating System on which the device runs
+ Whether 4G is available or not
+ Whether 5G is available or not
