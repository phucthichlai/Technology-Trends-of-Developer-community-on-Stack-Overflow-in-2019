## **1. Introduction** :pushpin:

- **Objective**: The main objective of this report is to analyze technology usage trends as well as demographic features in the software developing work fields.

- **Target Audiences**: The findings may bring about considerable referencing benefits for: Aspiring developers, IT students, HR, Corporate managers, Policy makers.

## **2. Methodology**:microscope:

- **Data Source:** ["Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019"](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/) The dataset was from an online survey of software developers around the world conducted by Stack Overflow in 2019. 

- **Data Collection:** The dataset was loaded from IBM Cloud into a data frame by using Pandas. The data visualized in the Appendix was collected by web scraping and APIs.

- **License:** The data is available for download under an Open Database License.

- **Data wrangling:**
• Duplicate removal, missing values imputation and data normalization
were conducted on the dataset using Python.

- **Analysis & Visualization:**
• Possible factors were visualized, then outliers were removed before correlation was calculated between the targeted variable and other numerical variables by using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Pandas.
• A Cognos dashboard was made visualizing the key insights about technology usage trends and demographics.

## **3. Findings Summary** :bulb:

Some significant insights generated include:
- The technology usage trend (e.g. which languages, platforms, databases,... are used the most) at the time of data collection.
- The technology usage trend in the next years.
- Gender gaps in the software developing industry.
